# Project 0 - About Me

### Overview
This is my first project as a WDI student at General Assembly SF.  I have used the skills I've learned so far in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build a website About Me.

## Technologies Used

### References
I used previous homework and exercises to aid my creating flexboxes.

For the carousel slideshow of my past projects, I read this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp">W3Schools tutorial</a> and ultimately used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/">Bootstrap's carousel component</a>.

I searched on Stack Overflow for many questions I had for the JS functions.
To rotate content in and out of my skills section, I referenced this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3670487/jquery-text-fade-transition-from-one-text-to-another">thread</a>.

## My Process/Approach
I started by going through the requirements that the site should contain.  I then created a wireframe to help me visually lay out my sections and what they might be.

From there, I wrote pseudocode in my HTML, CSS, and JS files to write down what content I needed to include, what styles or layout I needed to apply, and what functions to implement.  After ensuring I had all points and requirements written in pseudocode, I began to build out my HTML, starting with a boilerplate.

Once I had my content blocked in my HTML, I started working on CSS styles to change the layout.

After getting the basic layout accomplished with margins and padding adjusted, I got started on the more complex requirements of the project, beginning with the carousel of projects.

## My Biggest Wins and Challenges
Without fail, I struggle with flexbox, so I was very happy to achieve the flexbox effects I wanted in both the header and the contact form.
